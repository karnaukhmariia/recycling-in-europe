## Pollution & ennvironmental taxes

Got the data from eurostat expressed as % of PIB, obtained almost 0 correlation. Maybe because the numbers are very small (low variance) and should normalize. We could also do it per capita, as millions alone imply that bigger economies will recycle more because of this, but that mainly will correlate with GDP.

Worked with tot_env_tax and pollut_tax_value, found -0.15 and -0.03 correlation. Removed this variables and started working with millions per capita for pollut_tax_value (more correlated value, specific to waste taxes).
